What is a POJO Class in java?
	 - A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a simple object in Java that doesn't adhere to any special restriction 
	  other than those forced by the Java Language Specification and does not require any classpath. 
	  Here are the key points that define a POJO class:

	- No Implements: It does not implement any special interfaces such as Serializable, Externalizable, etc.
	- No Extends: It does not extend prespecified classes which may force it to behave in a certain way.
	- Simple Fields: Fields should be private to achieve encapsulation. Fields can be accessed directly 
	  via getters and setters.
	- Zero-arg Constructor: Often includes a no-argument constructor.
