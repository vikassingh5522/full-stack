
// ü´°üëç- Overriding:

// Overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already 
// defined in the parent class. It is an example of runtime polymorphism.

// - Key Points of Overriding:
//    - Happens between parent and child classes.
//    - Method signature (name, parameters, and return type) must be exactly the same.
//    - Resolved at runtime (dynamic method dispatch).
//    - The access modifier of the overriding method must be the same or more permissive 
//      than the method in the parent class.
