# Full-Stack Java Learning Repository

This repository contains a wide range of Java programs and examples that cover
fundamental to advanced concepts in programming. It also includes C and C++
snippets for additional practice.

## Topics Covered
- Core Java basics: variables, arrays, loops, strings
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- Constructors and method overloading
- Exception handling
- Nested classes and interfaces
- Multithreading and synchronization
- Association and composition
- C and C++ examples for system-level programming

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to serve as a personal learning hub and reference
for mastering Java and preparing for full-stack development. It will be expanded
to include backend frameworks (Spring Boot), frontend technologies (React, Angular),
databases (MySQL, MongoDB), and deployment practices.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikassingh5522/full-stack.git
````

2. Navigate to the desired example folder.
3. Compile and run Java files:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```

## Future Roadmap

* Build a sample full-stack project (Java backend + frontend + database).
* Add Spring Boot REST APIs.
* Connect with React/Angular frontend.
* Integrate databases for persistence.
* Explore deployment with Docker and cloud services.
